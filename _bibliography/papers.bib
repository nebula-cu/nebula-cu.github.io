  abstract          = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract  = {Serverless platforms rely on legacy networking stacks for communication and data movement. We quantitatively analyze the performance of these stacks and show their mismatch with highly consolidated, virtualized modern serverless environments, focusing on Firecracker, the most common serverless virtualization framework. As serverless applications grow in complexity and interaction, the resulting network bottleneck is a prime source of user-perceived, end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present a detailed vision of a new, sidecar-based networking stack for serverless environments. Our primary design goal is to provide low-overhead networking while maintaining existing security guarantees. We outline the research challenges in both the control and the data plane that the community needs to tackle before such a sidecar architecture can be used in practice.},
